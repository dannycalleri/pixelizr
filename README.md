Pixelizr
========

A little, customizable Javascript game that you can use to create your own interactive pixelated logo. 
Be creative! Write your name, your company name, or whatever you want! Have fun!

How-to
--------------------------------------

You only need 3 things:

1. pixelizr.js
2. a div with "pixelizr" id.
3. the code contained in the bottom of the included index.html

Simply grab the HTML file accompanying the script and start customizing the "level"
array.

Put "1" where you want your writing to be and "0" for the void space.
Simple!


Contribution
--------------------------------------
The code is thoroughly commented, but if you run into any problem, let me know! :)

In the spirit of open source software development, I always encourages community code contribution, so let's make a fork!
Just please let me know if you do something interesting with it.
